            <br>
        Productivity is never an accident. It is always the result of a commitment to excellence, intelligent planning,
        and focused effort. With such commitment, meticulous planning and focused effort, the mile stone of GMR
        VARALAKSHMI DAV PUBLIC SCHOOL was founded. The school was established on 20th January and came into effect on 14th
        June 2011. The arduous journey was started with a small crew of 46 students and 4 faculty members. But with the
        course of time we have grown incredibly. Now we are having not less than 650 students right from LKG to STD-X
        under the expert supervision of 26 teaching staff.
        <br><br>
        Our school is a part of the extended wings of DAV COLLEGE MANAGING COMMITTEE which is renowned widely for its
        yeoman service in the field of education. Our school aims to provide an environment of learning which will help
        to shape the nation of tomorrow. We aim to provide an integrated learning structure. To achieve this, we bring
        together the best technology and systems, logistics and infrastructure, highly qualified and competent
        faculties, excellent learning materials. And the most important of all we believe in the vision of making the
        child a role model for the society.
        <br><br>
        We, the DAVIANS of GMR are committed to offer the students the balanced learning opportunities in the five
        aspects of development i.e. moral, intellectual, physical, social and aesthetic as well as nurture them to be
        responsible citizens. We aim to provide holistic education that emphasizes in consistency and hard work. Over
        the years our school has scaled many new heights with the committed support of the management and cooperation of
        the parents.

        <h3>VISION & VISIONARIES</h3><br>

        The DAV institutions are the gift of Arya Samaj, a progressive movement founded by Swami Dayanand Saraswati
        in 1875. Swami Dayanand Sarswati, the path-maker of modern India, led a crusade against the superstitious
        and pernicious practices that prevailed in contemporary India.

        With a view to bringing about a balanced and harmonious development of the future citizens of this country
        and to infuse in them the ideals of Vedic Culture and high sense of patriotism, Arya Samaj founded a school
        at Lahore in 1886 by the name of DAYANAND ANGLO VEDIC SCHOOL. This established the DAV College Trust &
        Management Society, which later set up a network of such educational institutions all over India and abroad.

        The DAV Movement would not have achieved its goal had not a young, brilliant graduate-Mahatma Hansraj- the
        first Principal of the first DAV institution offered his honorary services as 'Jeevan Daanâ€™, for 25 years.
        Matchless also is the sacrifice of his brother, Lala Mulkraj, who fulfilled his pledge of supporting
        Hansraj's family all these years.

        Presently, it is the largest non-government Educational Organization in the country, managing over 700
        Educational Institutions.
